## LLM annotation of Cellular Senescence from Figures in Review Articles

## Overview
This study uses Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4V and GPT-4 Turbo, in annotating biomedical figures, focusing on cellular senescence. 


## Outcome
1.	Human annotation: 240 relations
2.	LLM annotation
   Step 1: Extract node label from figures 
   Step 2: Determine node type(process, molecues/genes, chemical compounds, cell, disease).
   Step3: Determine source, target of edge
   Step4: Determine edge type (promote/suppress)   
3. Evaluation of the performance of LLM: precision, recall, and F1 score metrics for steps 1 and 3 and accuracy for steps 2 and 4.
