These stresses trigger the upregulation of key cell cycle inhibitors, namely p16INK4a, p21CIP1, p53, p15INK4b, p14ARF, and p27KIP1, leading to a permanent cell cycle arrest (either in G1 or G2 phase). BCL-2 and PI3K/AKT anti-apoptotic pathways also become upregulated, bestowing senescent cells (SCs) with resistance to apoptotic cues. Other phenotypic alterations include an enlarged cell size (up to 2.5 times the normal counterpart) and metabolic changes such as mitochondrial and lysosomal expansion, which increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the activity of lysosomal senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal, detected at pH 6.0). ROS accumulation induces protein aggregates which crosslink with sugars and lipids and form insoluble lipofuscin aggresomes. Autophagy rate is increased during the early senescence programme but is highly compromised in later stages. SCs are characterized by a complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that comprises a plethora of different growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and matrix components. Primary transcriptional activators of the SASP include nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (c/EBPβ), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). SASP factors, such as IL-6, IL-8, Gro-α, IGFBP-7, and PAI-1, reinforce the senescence programme in an autocrine manner, while others, like ROS, IFN-γ, TGF-β, IL-1α, VEGF, CCL2, and CCL20, induce paracrine senescence in neighbouring cells. Upon the initiation of the senescence programme, the chromatin suffers deep modifications towards the repression of proliferation-related genes and the stimulation of SASP-related genes. This results in the appearance of DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence (DNA-SCARS) as well as senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). Chromatin alterations are accompanied by a downregulation of lamin B1, a major component of the nuclear lamina, compromising its integrity and leading to the extravasation of chromatin fragments into the cytosol. Cytosolic chromatin fragments (CCFs) are recognized by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which, in turn, triggers the activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway stimulates pro-inflammatory SASP responses through upregulation of NF-κB.

BCL-2 and PI3K/AKT anti-apoptotic pathways also become upregulated, bestowing senescent cells (SCs) with resistance to apoptotic cues. Other phenotypic alterations include an enlarged cell size (up to 2.5 times the normal counterpart) and metabolic changes such as mitochondrial and lysosomal expansion, which increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the activity of lysosomal senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal, detected at pH 6.0). ROS accumulation induces protein aggregates which crosslink with sugars and lipids and form insoluble lipofuscin aggresomes. Autophagy rate is increased during the early senescence programme but is highly compromised in later stages. SCs are characterized by a complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that comprises a plethora of different growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and matrix components.

SASP factors, such as IL-6, IL-8, Gro-α, IGFBP-7, and PAI-1, reinforce the senescence programme in an autocrine manner, while others, like ROS, IFN-γ, TGF-β, IL-1α, VEGF, CCL2, and CCL20, induce paracrine senescence in neighbouring cells. Upon the initiation of the senescence programme, the chromatin suffers deep modifications towards the repression of proliferation-related genes and the stimulation of SASP-related genes. This results in the appearance of DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence (DNA-SCARS) as well as senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). Chromatin alterations are accompanied by a downregulation of lamin B1, a major component of the nuclear lamina, compromising its integrity and leading to the extravasation of chromatin fragments into the cytosol. Cytosolic chromatin fragments (CCFs) are recognized by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which, in turn, triggers the activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway stimulates pro-inflammatory SASP responses through upregulation of NF-κB.

Other phenotypic alterations include an enlarged cell size (up to 2.5 times the normal counterpart) and metabolic changes such as mitochondrial and lysosomal expansion, which increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the activity of lysosomal senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal, detected at pH 6.0). ROS accumulation induces protein aggregates which crosslink with sugars and lipids and form insoluble lipofuscin aggresomes. Autophagy rate is increased during the early senescence programme but is highly compromised in later stages. SCs are characterized by a complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that comprises a plethora of different growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and matrix components. Primary transcriptional activators of the SASP include nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (c/EBPβ), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). SASP factors, such as IL-6, IL-8, Gro-α, IGFBP-7, and PAI-1, reinforce the senescence programme in an autocrine manner, while others, like ROS, IFN-γ, TGF-β, IL-1α, VEGF, CCL2, and CCL20, induce paracrine senescence in neighbouring cells. Upon the initiation of the senescence programme, the chromatin suffers deep modifications towards the repression of proliferation-related genes and the stimulation of SASP-related genes. This results in the appearance of DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence (DNA-SCARS) as well as senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). Chromatin alterations are accompanied by a downregulation of lamin B1, a major component of the nuclear lamina, compromising its integrity and leading to the extravasation of chromatin fragments into the cytosol. Cytosolic chromatin fragments (CCFs) are recognized by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which, in turn, triggers the activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway stimulates pro-inflammatory SASP responses through upregulation of NF-κB. Recent studies suggest that urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a cell-surface protein, is also broadly expressed during senescence.

BCL-2 and PI3K/AKT anti-apoptotic pathways also become upregulated, bestowing senescent cells (SCs) with resistance to apoptotic cues. Other phenotypic alterations include an enlarged cell size (up to 2.5 times the normal counterpart) and metabolic changes such as mitochondrial and lysosomal expansion, which increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the activity of lysosomal senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal, detected at pH 6.0). ROS accumulation induces protein aggregates which crosslink with sugars and lipids and form insoluble lipofuscin aggresomes. Autophagy rate is increased during the early senescence programme but is highly compromised in later stages. SCs are characterized by a complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that comprises a plethora of different growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and matrix components.

SASP factors, such as IL-6, IL-8, Gro-α, IGFBP-7, and PAI-1, reinforce the senescence programme in an autocrine manner, while others, like ROS, IFN-γ, TGF-β, IL-1α, VEGF, CCL2, and CCL20, induce paracrine senescence in neighbouring cells. Upon the initiation of the senescence programme, the chromatin suffers deep modifications towards the repression of proliferation-related genes and the stimulation of SASP-related genes. This results in the appearance of DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence (DNA-SCARS) as well as senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). Chromatin alterations are accompanied by a downregulation of lamin B1, a major component of the nuclear lamina, compromising its integrity and leading to the extravasation of chromatin fragments into the cytosol. Cytosolic chromatin fragments (CCFs) are recognized by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which, in turn, triggers the activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING).

This results in the appearance of DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence (DNA-SCARS) as well as senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). Chromatin alterations are accompanied by a downregulation of lamin B1, a major component of the nuclear lamina, compromising its integrity and leading to the extravasation of chromatin fragments into the cytosol. Cytosolic chromatin fragments (CCFs) are recognized by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which, in turn, triggers the activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway stimulates pro-inflammatory SASP responses through upregulation of NF-κB. Recent studies suggest that urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a cell-surface protein, is also broadly expressed during senescence.

Proliferation-induced telomere shortening can also activate the DNA damage response, which in turn leads to activation of the p53–p21 pathway, inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)–cyclin complexes and formation of the DREAM complex, which represses cell-cycle genes, leading to cell-cycle arrest and senescence. Activated p21 can also induce further ROS production, forming a vicious circle. In addition, impaired mitophagy can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive ROS production. ROS can induce senescence independently of the DNA damage response by activating the p16–RB pathway via activation of ERK, which inhibits BMI1 and thereby enables activation of p16, and by activating p38MAPK signalling, which upregulates ETS2 and in turn activates p16, and by inhibiting NAD+, which leads to reduced expression of sirtuin 1 and activation of FOXO3, which activates p53. P16 inhibits the formation of CDK4/6–cyclin D complexes and thereby promotes formation of the RB–2F complex, which inhibits the transcription of cell-cycle genes. Oncogene activation can activate the p53–p21 pathway not only via the DNA damage response, but also via the ARF–MDM2 signalling. In addition, oncogene activation can activate the p16–RB pathway via p38MAPK signalling. Loss of tumour suppressor genes induces senescence via Akt–mTOR signalling, which activates p53. Other factors that regulate the p53–p21 pathway include α-Klotho, MBP1 and p300. Epigenetic alterations such as methylation (Me) and acetylation (Ac) can induce senescence through the p16–RB pathway. NF-κB signalling regulates the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and together with the transcription factor C/EBPβ, co-activates promoters of SASP genes, such as those that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines. The DNA damage response protein ATM together with NEMO activates the NF-κB–C/EBPβ signalling pathway. ROS can activate the SASP not only by promoting nuclear translocation of NEMO and activation of ATM, but also by inhibiting sirtuin 1 and activating p38MAPK and TGFβ, which in turn activate NF-κB. Heat shock, metabolic disorders, mechanical damage and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can also activate the NF-κB–C/EBPβ pathway via p38MAPK signalling. Cytoplasmic DNA accumulation can trigger aberrant activation of cGAS-STING cytoplasmic DNA sensors and promote the SASP via activation of NF-κB.

ROS can induce senescence independently of the DNA damage response by activating the p16–RB pathway via activation of ERK, which inhibits BMI1 and thereby enables activation of p16, and by activating p38MAPK signalling, which upregulates ETS2 and in turn activates p16, and by inhibiting NAD+, which leads to reduced expression of sirtuin 1 and activation of FOXO3, which activates p53. P16 inhibits the formation of CDK4/6–cyclin D complexes and thereby promotes formation of the RB–2F complex, which inhibits the transcription of cell-cycle genes. Oncogene activation can activate the p53–p21 pathway not only via the DNA damage response, but also via the ARF–MDM2 signalling. In addition, oncogene activation can activate the p16–RB pathway via p38MAPK signalling. Loss of tumour suppressor genes induces senescence via Akt–mTOR signalling, which activates p53. Other factors that regulate the p53–p21 pathway include α-Klotho, MBP1 and p300. Epigenetic alterations such as methylation (Me) and acetylation (Ac) can induce senescence through the p16–RB pathway. NF-κB signalling regulates the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and together with the transcription factor C/EBPβ, co-activates promoters of SASP genes, such as those that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines. The DNA damage response protein ATM together with NEMO activates the NF-κB–C/EBPβ signalling pathway. ROS can activate the SASP not only by promoting nuclear translocation of NEMO and activation of ATM, but also by inhibiting sirtuin 1 and activating p38MAPK and TGFβ, which in turn activate NF-κB. Heat shock, metabolic disorders, mechanical damage and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can also activate the NF-κB–C/EBPβ pathway via p38MAPK signalling. Cytoplasmic DNA accumulation can trigger aberrant activation of cGAS-STING cytoplasmic DNA sensors and promote the SASP via activation of NF-κB. Impairment of autophagy hampers degradation of the transcription factor GATA4, which activates NF-κB and leads to initiation of the SASP.

ROS can induce senescence independently of the DNA damage response by activating the p16–RB pathway via activation of ERK, which inhibits BMI1 and thereby enables activation of p16, and by activating p38MAPK signalling, which upregulates ETS2 and in turn activates p16, and by inhibiting NAD+, which leads to reduced expression of sirtuin 1 and activation of FOXO3, which activates p53. P16 inhibits the formation of CDK4/6–cyclin D complexes and thereby promotes formation of the RB–2F complex, which inhibits the transcription of cell-cycle genes. Oncogene activation can activate the p53–p21 pathway not only via the DNA damage response, but also via the ARF–MDM2 signalling. In addition, oncogene activation can activate the p16–RB pathway via p38MAPK signalling. Loss of tumour suppressor genes induces senescence via Akt–mTOR signalling, which activates p53. Other factors that regulate the p53–p21 pathway include α-Klotho, MBP1 and p300. Epigenetic alterations such as methylation (Me) and acetylation (Ac) can induce senescence through the p16–RB pathway. NF-κB signalling regulates the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and together with the transcription factor C/EBPβ, co-activates promoters of SASP genes, such as those that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines. The DNA damage response protein ATM together with NEMO activates the NF-κB–C/EBPβ signalling pathway. ROS can activate the SASP not only by promoting nuclear translocation of NEMO and activation of ATM, but also by inhibiting sirtuin 1 and activating p38MAPK and TGFβ, which in turn activate NF-κB. Heat shock, metabolic disorders, mechanical damage and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can also activate the NF-κB–C/EBPβ pathway via p38MAPK signalling. Cytoplasmic DNA accumulation can trigger aberrant activation of cGAS-STING cytoplasmic DNA sensors and promote the SASP via activation of NF-κB. Impairment of autophagy hampers degradation of the transcription factor GATA4, which activates NF-κB and leads to initiation of the SASP.

ROS can induce senescence independently of the DNA damage response by activating the p16–RB pathway via activation of ERK, which inhibits BMI1 and thereby enables activation of p16, and by activating p38MAPK signalling, which upregulates ETS2 and in turn activates p16, and by inhibiting NAD+, which leads to reduced expression of sirtuin 1 and activation of FOXO3, which activates p53. P16 inhibits the formation of CDK4/6–cyclin D complexes and thereby promotes formation of the RB–2F complex, which inhibits the transcription of cell-cycle genes. Oncogene activation can activate the p53–p21 pathway not only via the DNA damage response, but also via the ARF–MDM2 signalling. In addition, oncogene activation can activate the p16–RB pathway via p38MAPK signalling. Loss of tumour suppressor genes induces senescence via Akt–mTOR signalling, which activates p53. Other factors that regulate the p53–p21 pathway include α-Klotho, MBP1 and p300. Epigenetic alterations such as methylation (Me) and acetylation (Ac) can induce senescence through the p16–RB pathway. NF-κB signalling regulates the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and together with the transcription factor C/EBPβ, co-activates promoters of SASP genes, such as those that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines. The DNA damage response protein ATM together with NEMO activates the NF-κB–C/EBPβ signalling pathway. ROS can activate the SASP not only by promoting nuclear translocation of NEMO and activation of ATM, but also by inhibiting sirtuin 1 and activating p38MAPK and TGFβ, which in turn activate NF-κB. Heat shock, metabolic disorders, mechanical damage and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can also activate the NF-κB–C/EBPβ pathway via p38MAPK signalling. Cytoplasmic DNA accumulation can trigger aberrant activation of cGAS-STING cytoplasmic DNA sensors and promote the SASP via activation of NF-κB. Impairment of autophagy hampers degradation of the transcription factor GATA4, which activates NF-κB and leads to initiation of the SASP. Notably, oncogenic Ras can activate C/EBPβ via ERK–p90 signalling and histone epigenetic changes can regulate the SASP independently of the NF-κB–C/EBPβ pathway.

Heat shock, metabolic disorders, mechanical damage and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can also activate the NF-κB–C/EBPβ pathway via p38MAPK signalling. Cytoplasmic DNA accumulation can trigger aberrant activation of cGAS-STING cytoplasmic DNA sensors and promote the SASP via activation of NF-κB.
