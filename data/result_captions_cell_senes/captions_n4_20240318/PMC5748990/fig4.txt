The image provided is a schematic representation of various diseases associated with cellular senescence markers and their investigation in specific mouse models (p16- or p53- mice), as well as the potential therapeutic effect of senolytic drugs. The image also includes references for the information presented.

Label Identification:
- Diseases: Glaucoma, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), Atherosclerosis, Liver cirrhosis / NAFLD, Glomerulosclerosis, Type 2 Diabetes, Cachexia, Sarcopenia, Osteoarthritis
- Senescence Markers: Presence indicated by check marks
- Mouse Models: p16- or p53- mice, presence indicated by check marks
- Senolytic: Presence indicated by check marks
- References: Citations for each disease

Classification of information:
- Molecule/Gene: Not explicitly mentioned, but implied by "Senescence Markers" and "p16- or p53- mice"
- Chemical Substance: Implied by "Senolytic" (senolytic drugs)
- Cell: Not explicitly mentioned, but cellular senescence is the process involving cells
- Process: Cellular senescence, therapeutic intervention
- Disease: Glaucoma, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), Atherosclerosis, Liver cirrhosis / NAFLD, Glomerulosclerosis, Type 2 Diabetes, Cachexia, Sarcopenia, Osteoarthritis

Identification of relationships:
- Senescence Markers are related to the listed diseases.
- p16- or p53- mouse models are used to study the relationship between senescence and diseases.
- Senolytic drugs are related to the potential treatment of these diseases.

Output the type of relationship:
- Positive relationship: Presence of Senescence Markers is associated with the diseases.
- Negative relationship: Senolytic drugs are intended to counteract the effects of senescence in these diseases.

Organization and output of results:
The image organizes the results in a table format, with diseases listed in the first column, followed by columns indicating the presence of senescence markers, the use of specific mouse models, the application of senolytic drugs, and the references supporting the information. The schematic human figure highlights the organs and systems affected by the diseases, providing a visual context for where senescence markers are relevant in the body.
