Most carcinogenic mutations induce senescence through the p53–p21 and p16–RB pathways, although some mutations activate p21 directly. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced senescence in cancer cells is mainly dependent on p16, p21 and/or p27. Senescence-induced cell-cycle arrest can prevent mutations from being passed on to the next generation of cells and accelerate immune clearance, resulting in suppression of tumurigenesis. However, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) also contributes to a pro-inflammatory and growth-stimulatory microenvironment that can promote tumour development.
