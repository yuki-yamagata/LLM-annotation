The SASP mediates many of the cell-extrinsic functions of senescent cells. Among those it reinforces several aspects of senescence including growth arrest and the SASP itself via an autocrine loop. The SASP also recruits immune cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells to phagocytose and eliminate the senescent cell. Secretion of MMPs and factors such as VEGF can remodel the surrounding tissue, inducing angiogenesis and reducing fibrosis. Finally, secretion of molecules such as TGF-Î² can spread the senescence phenotype in a paracrine manner to surrounding cells.
